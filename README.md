# lvgl\_micropython Builder
This project provides a Bash script to build a binary image to use Micropython
with LVGL support on your Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch LCD-7 board. The base
project [lvgl\_micropython](https://github.com/lvgl-micropython/lvgl_micropython)
is developed by RD Schlosser who implements the bindings to LVGL-9.2.2 and the
environment to build all the stuff.
